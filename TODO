turn on perl taint mode 
disallow creating a joot inside a joot (causes problems with mount points, sockets, etc)
test what happens when we run out of /dev/nbdN devices which there are 16 of
make the qcow disk size something bigger than 10GB when it's installed (option to --create)
why does groups cmd inside joot think i'm a member of "root"
automatically link common sockets (ssh, x11, etc) into joot 
add --mount and --unmount actions
