Joot is a utility that manages disk images and chroots to provide you with 
quick clean room environments for development, testing and package management.

Goals
-----
  * fast (subsecond) to create and destroy
  * only limitation on number of joots is disk space
  * use COW and sparse disks when possible
  * few dependencies (fast and easy installs)
  * support debian/redhat base os install out of the box
  * support AMIs (Amazon ec2), and VMDK (VMware) images
  * manage system files inside chroot (such as /etc/resolv.conf and /proc/*) 
    when reasonable

Status
------
This project is considered alpha.  I'd love to hear your feedback if you want
try it out.  

Prereqs
-------
On Debian, you'll need to install these packages:
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
sudo apt-get install mount sudo qemu-kvm libjson-perl liblog-log4perl-perl \
libwww-perl perl-modules  -y

# for development only 
sudo apt-get install libtest-perl-critic-perl libtest-exception-perl \
libtest-pod-perl -y
export PERL5LIB=~/joot/lib
alias joot="sudo PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB ~/joot/bin/joot"

linux kernel 2.6.26 for nbd support (ubuntu release intrepid ibex or later)
When you mount a joot it uses a /dev/nbdX device.  
sudo modprobe nbd nbds_max=256

Creating Images
---------------
CentOS:
http://geek.co.il/wp/2010/03/14/how-to-build-a-chroot-jail-environment-for-centos

Ubuntu/Debian:
export image_name=debian-5.0-i386-`date +%Y%m%d`
export image_file=~/images/$image_name.qcow2
joot_image --create $image_file --size 10G
joot_image --mount $image_file /mnt/$image_name
sudo apt-get install debootstrap
sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch i386 lucid \
    /mnt/$image_name/ http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
sudo chroot /mnt/$image_name bash -c  "apt-get install -y --force-yes sudo language-pack-en vim ssh man && apt-get clean"
joot_image --umount $image_file
sudo rmdir /mnt/$image_name

Eventually I hope to publish a collection of images a la stacklet.com (but 
without the paywall).

Configuration
-------------
Joot will look for a config options in JOOT_CONFIG env var, ~/.joot or 
/etc/joot.cfg in that order.
