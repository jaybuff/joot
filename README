Joot is a utility that manages disk images and chroots to provide you with 
quick clean room environments for development, testing and package management.

Goals
-----
  * fast (subsecond) to create and destroy
  * only limitation on number of joots is disk space
  * use COW and sparse disks when possible
  * few dependencies (fast and easy installs)
  * support debian/redhat base os install out of the box
  * support AMIs (Amazon ec2), and VMDK (VMware) images
  * manage system files inside chroot (such as /etc/resolv.conf and /proc/*) 
    when reasonable

Status
------
This project is currently under development and not yet usable. 

Prereqs
-------
On Debian, you'll need to install these packages:
sudo apt-get install nbd-client qemu-kvm libyaml-tiny-perl liblog-log4perl-perl perl-modules -y
TODO: what packages provide sudo, mount, tar and ext3?

linux kernel 2.6.26 for nbd support (ubuntu release intrepid ibex or later)
sudo modprobe nbd # we can safely run this even if it's already loaded

Creating Images
-------------
CentOS:
http://geek.co.il/wp/2010/03/14/how-to-build-a-chroot-jail-environment-for-centos

Ubuntu/Debian:
mkdir /tmp/lucid
debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch i386 lucid \
     /tmp/lucid http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
sudo chroot /tmp/lucid apt-get clean
cd /tmp/lucid
tar cf /tmp/lucid.tar *
rm -rf /tmp/lucid

Eventually I hope to publish a collection of images a la stacklet.com (but 
without the paywall).

Notes
-----
Joot will look for a config options in ~/.joot or /etc/joot.cfg in that order.
