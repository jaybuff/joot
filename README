Joot is a utility that manages disk images and chroots to provide you with 
quick clean room environments for development, testing and package management.

Goals
-----
  * fast (subsecond) to create and destroy
  * only limitation on number of joots is disk space
  * use COW and sparse disks when possible
  * few dependencies (fast and easy installs)
  * support debian/redhat base os install out of the box
  * support AMIs (Amazon ec2), and VMDK (VMware) images
  * manage system files inside chroot (such as /etc/resolv.conf and /proc/*) 
    when reasonable

Status
------
This project is currently under development and not yet usable. 

Prereqs
-------
On Debian, you'll need to install these packages:
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
sudo apt-get install nbd-client qemu-kvm libjson-perl liblog-log4perl-perl perl-modules -y
TODO: what packages provide sudo, mount, tar and ext3?

linux kernel 2.6.26 for nbd support (ubuntu release intrepid ibex or later)
sudo modprobe nbd # we can safely run this even if it's already loaded

Creating Images
-------------
CentOS:
http://geek.co.il/wp/2010/03/14/how-to-build-a-chroot-jail-environment-for-centos

Ubuntu/Debian:
export image_name=debian-5.0-i386-`date +%Y%m%d`
export image=/tmp/$image_name.qcow2
sudo su  
qemu-img create -f qcow2 $image 10G
qemu-nbd --connect /dev/nbd0 --socket /tmp/$image_name.sock $image
mkfs.ext3 -b 4096 /dev/nbd0 
mkdir -p /mnt/$image_name/
mount /dev/nbd0 /mnt/$image_name/
apt-get install debootstrap
debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch i386 lucid \
    /mnt/$image_name/ http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
chroot /mnt/$image_name apt-get clean
umount /dev/nbd0
qemu-nbd --disconnect /dev/nbd0
rmdir /mnt/$image_name

Eventually I hope to publish a collection of images a la stacklet.com (but 
without the paywall).

Notes
-----
Joot will look for a config options in JOOT_CONFIG env var, ~/.joot or 
/etc/joot.cfg in that order.
